const faqs = [

  { q: "How are properties selected?", a: "Each stay is scored on ten criteria — from architectural quality and safety to authenticity and operational readiness. Only properties that clear our systematic checks and an on-site curated inspection earn the badge." },
  { q: "Can I list my property?", a: "Yes — start from Business → Host & List. You'll submit details, photos and papers; our checks run within 24 hours, then a manager calls you to approve the unit for listing." },
  { q: "How can I become an investor?", a: "Choose from three models — Landowner Partnership, Land Leasing, or Joint Investment — under Business → Invest. Our investment desk maps you to the right one and returns are paid as a share of operating revenue." },
  { q: "Do you provide hospitality consultancy?", a: "Yes — architecture (master plans, drawings, BOQ, site supervision) and hospitality (business plans, revenue models, branding, operations manuals) consultancies are both bookable online." },
  { q: "How does the inspection process work?", a: "After your listing request clears the systematic pass, a regional inspector visits within 7 days, scores the property on our checklist, and only Approved & Published units ever appear in discovery." },

              <p>
                Travel has become commercialized. Most platforms focus on filling rooms and maximizing
                listings — making it hard for travellers to find truly meaningful places, while beautiful
                properties stay invisible without professional design, branding or operations.
              </p>
              <p>
                As architects and hospitality consultants, we saw this gap firsthand: incredible locations
                that never became destinations, and travellers who couldn&apos;t find experiences they could trust.
              </p>
              <p className="text-foreground font-medium">
                Dhyana Stays was created to bridge that gap — a platform where every stay is curated, every
                destination tells a story, and landowners, investors, architects and hospitality professionals
                build destinations together that are memorable, sustainable and financially successful.
