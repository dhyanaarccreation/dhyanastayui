// ============================================
// STAY CONTENT GENERATOR
// A reusable enrichment layer that derives display
// content (hero video, editorial story, curated
// experience tags, location guides) purely from a
// property's existing `category` and `location` —
// never hand-authored per property. Add a new stay
// to `properties` in mock-data.ts and it is fully
// enriched automatically; no UI component or content
// file needs to be touched.
//
// Swapping mock data for a real API later only means
// replacing `properties` in mock-data.ts (or the
// category/city maps below) with data fetched from a
// backend — `enrichProperty` and every consumer of it
// stay exactly the same.
