// ============================================

  { question: "What makes Dhyana Stays different from other booking platforms?", answer: "Every property on Dhyana Stays is personally inspected and scored across architecture, hospitality, sustainability, safety, and guest experience. We don't list every stay — we curate unforgettable experiences. Each property must pass a comprehensive quality inspection before being published.", category: "General" },
  { question: "How does the curated inspection process work?", answer: "Our expert inspectors evaluate every property across 7 categories: Architecture, Interior Design, Hospitality, Cleanliness, Sustainability, Safety, and Guest Experience. Properties scoring below 70/100 are not approved. Approved stays receive quality badges based on their scores.", category: "General" },
  { question: "What is the cancellation policy?", answer: "Cancellation policies vary by property. Most stays offer free cancellation up to 7-14 days before check-in. Each property's specific policy is clearly displayed on its listing page and during the booking process.", category: "Bookings" },
  { question: "How does the Split Investment model work?", answer: "Each curated hospitality project is divided into investment units. Investors purchase one or more units and receive proportional revenue share from bookings. Dhyana Stays handles all operations including design, construction, marketing, and guest management.", category: "Investment" },
  { question: "Can I list my property on Dhyana Stays?", answer: "Yes! Apply as a host through our platform. You'll need to complete KYC verification, submit property details and photos, and pass our Curated Stay Inspection. Only properties meeting our quality standards are published.", category: "Hosting" },
  { question: "What payment methods are accepted?", answer: "We accept UPI (GPay, PhonePe, Paytm), Credit/Debit Cards (Visa, MasterCard, RuPay), Net Banking, and Wallets. All payments are processed securely through Razorpay.", category: "Payments" },
  { question: "Do you offer experiences beyond accommodation?", answer: "Absolutely! Dhyana Stays offers curated local experiences including yoga sessions, cooking classes, farm tours, adventure activities, cycling tours, and more. You can add these during booking or book separately.", category: "Experiences" },
  { question: "Is there a loyalty program?", answer: "Yes! Our rewards program lets you earn points for bookings, reviews, referrals, and completing your profile. Points can be redeemed for discounts on future bookings. Premium membership offers additional benefits.", category: "Rewards" },
